Hello :) Welcome to the source code of my personal website! 

If you have any comments about things you think could be improved upon/optimized, feel free to let me know! I'm always looking for ways to improve its look/feel.

TODO:
- Create a project directory, with more detailed project info
- Add more javascript animations to make website look even cooler 😮‍💨
