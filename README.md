Hello :> Welcome to the files of my personal website! <br>
Link: https://flyonlyon.github.io/personalWebsite/

If you have any comments about things you think could be improved upon/optimized, please don't submit any pull requests, I'll end up denying them. I want this website to reflect my abilities as a developer, and having someone else do all the hard work feels a bit disingenuous. Feel free to comment or email and let me know what you noticed, as I'm always looking to improve my work!

NOTE: This website is still a work in progress, so it might still be broken. That's on purpose (for now)


TODO:
- Add/remove elements from navbar (Home?)
- Add links to nav bar
